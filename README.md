# Atari_Breakout

Classic Atari game coded and created with JavaScript and p5.js

Initial Instructions:

Integrate classes into the program.

My only complaint is that there's no 'win'.

Leave the bricks and paddle at the end of the game.

I think you could have done better on this in terms of structure. So what happens if your client Mr. Blumberg comes to you and wants you to try out a totally different brick design, but he's not sure he will like it? If you have a Brick class in a separate file, you can just swap out the file. And if you did your interface right, you won't even need to touch anything other than the Brick class file. The way you have it right now, you would need to back up the entire project and hope he doesn't ask for bugfixes after your brick modifications. Then how would you roll back? Mr. Blumberg would say, "Yeah . . . you're fired."
